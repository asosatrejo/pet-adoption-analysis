#  Pet Adoption Analysis
## Created by Team 5
We aim to increase the number of dogs & cats being adopted within North Carolina. To accomplish our goal, first, we must recognize what factors affect adoption rates. We will look at the pets, the shelters, and the areas to determine whether any significant data can be determined. After analyzing, we will conclude with our findings whether there are any pets that are being ignored, if a shelter has any shortcomings, or if specific areas, in general, affect the adoption rates. 

Our team will use the following APIs to extract data for our research.
  **API/Resources:**
  - [PetFinder API](https://www.petfinder.com/developers/)
  - [PetPy Python Wrapper](https://petpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html)

### Main Question:
How can we increase the overall adoption rate of cats & dogs in North Carolina?

### Important notes: 
- Our scope is subject to change to a national level depending on the data found and APIs. For the purposes of avoiding scope creep, we will not go beyond the national level.
- To avoid scope creep in the project we are focusing on how dogs & cats specifically are affected, while we do acknowledge there are more types of pets then one should also acknowledge that covering a large variety of pets will make the project less feasible in the long run. 

### Research Questions:
1. Which adoption organizations are most convenient for a potential customer to browse cats and/or dogs through social media?
2. Is a certain age, size, or sex of a dog/cat more/less likely to be adopted?
3. Does a certain area (location) have higher/lower adoption rates? 

These questions are to help us narrow our research to help find significant data that can provide an answer to our main question.

### Tasks/Team Member responsibilities:
#### Each individual: 
- Will create the slides for their focus question, and aim to answer their focus and main question
- Will clean their data, create graphs, and do the majority of work for their focus question
- Review the overall project including slides, peer work, and ReadMe to make sure rubric requirements are met
- Help out other team members to the best of their ability

#### Individual Tasks/Responsibilities:
- Ariana - Host the Repository, focus on question 3, 
- Dwight - Host the Presentation, focus on question 2
- Ross - Focus on ReadMe, focus on question 1


# Requirements
