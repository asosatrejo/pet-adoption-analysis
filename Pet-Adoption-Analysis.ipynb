    "We aim to increase the number of dogs & cats being adopted within North Carolina. To accomplish our goal, first, we must recognize what factors affect adoption rates. We will look at the pets, the shelters, and the areas to determine whether any significant data can be determined. After analyzing, we will conclude with our findings whether there are any pets that are being ignored, if a shelter has any shortcomings, or if specific areas, in general, affect the adoption rates.
